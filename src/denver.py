"""denver -- Development Environment Launcher.

Launch a reproducible development environment described by a ``denver.yml``
file: denver resolves it (following ``import:`` inheritance), then runs the
generic *providers* its ``stages:`` list names (uv, conan, zephyr, docker,
...) to build/enter the environment purely from config.

A command to run, if given, must be introduced with '--' (e.g.
`denver <env> -- echo hi`); everything after it is forwarded as-is. With no
command, denver starts an interactive shell.

If an env stacks a wrapper provider (e.g. docker), running it builds/enters
the container and re-invokes denver inside with --skip <that stage>, so the
remaining providers build the environment there; skip the wrapper yourself
(e.g. `denver <env> --skip docker`) to run that same stack on the host
instead.

<env> is a path to a directory containing a denver.yml, or a path directly
to a YAML config file (any name, e.g. denver.debug.yml -- lets one folder
hold several denver.xxx.yml variants).

--dry-run answers "what does this env actually run?" without running it:
every stage is walked in order, but its commands and file writes are printed
(prefixed '[dry-run]') instead of performed, and the final command is printed
instead of launched. Read-only queries and sourced scripts do still run --
they are what the printed commands are derived from; see README.md for the
full marker legend and the wrapper-boundary caveat.

Run `denver --help` to see every flag, and README.md for the full
behavioural reference (-c's dotted-path/+= syntax, --run's 'scripts:'
mechanism, the wrapper relocation model, ...).

Examples:
    src/denver.py examples/zephyr-devshell-4.3.1
    src/denver.py examples/zephyr-devshell-4.3.1 -- echo hello

    layer's own entries, in that order (e.g. a derived env's
    ``recipe-dirs:`` doesn't need to repeat its base's dirs to keep them --
    they're kept automatically, and the derived env only lists what it adds).
    Prefix one entry with ``!`` to drop everything from the lower layer
    instead, e.g.::

        recipe-dirs:
        - "!only-this-dir"

    which discards every entry the lower layer set (the ``!`` is stripped

    A bare ``<overwrite>`` entry does the same (drops every lower-layer

        recipe-dirs:

    set the same key to a different string, that's almost always an
    accidental divergent override (e.g. two stacked layers disagreeing on
    ``uv.python``), so it's a hard error instead of a silent override.
    Prefix the overriding value with ``!`` to do it deliberately, e.g.::

        uv:
          python: "!3.12.3"

    which discards whatever a lower layer set (the ``!`` is stripped from
    the stored value). For both lists and strings, the ``!`` is only an
    escape when there's an actual lower-layer value to override -- a
    genuinely new key (no lower layer at all, ``base is _UNSET``) keeps a
    leading ``!`` as a literal character, so an ordinary value that happens
    to start with ``!`` (e.g. a shell history-expansion string) isn't

    Used inside a wrapper (e.g. docker): the same denver runs again inside the
    container, where the wrapper is inactive and uv/conan/zephyr build/enter
    the environment. denver's sources are available at the same path (the
    workspace is bind-mounted) -- ``Path(__file__).resolve()`` is this exact
    file's own absolute path, so this works unchanged whether denver runs
    from a checkout or an editable install (both keep ``__file__`` pointing
    into the checkout); a non-editable install only re-invokes correctly if
    the container has denver installed at that same absolute path too.
    ``python3`` (a bare command, not this host's interpreter path) is looked
    up wherever the command actually runs -- the container's PATH, not the
    host's -- matching docker.wrap()'s own bare-name commands.
    Running as a frozen single-file executable (see
    scripts/create-python-exe.sh) there is no denver.py to hand to an
    interpreter at all: ``__file__`` then names a file inside PyInstaller's
    per-run extraction directory that is never actually written (the modules
    live in an archive inside the executable), and the container's ``python3``
    would need denver's dependencies -- exactly what that build exists to
    avoid. So the executable re-invokes *itself*, by its own absolute path,
    which the wrapper makes resolvable inside the relocated environment by
    bind-mounting it there (see docker.py's _frozen_denver_mount).
    ``wrapper_stage_ids`` (the active wrapper(s) relocating this command) are
    each passed as their own ``--skip``, so the re-invoked denver's own stage
    filtering drops them from 'stages:' and never tries to relocate again.
    ``until_stage``/``skip_stages`` are the user's *original* --until/--skip
    (consumed out of ``forwarded`` by the outer main(), same as
    quiet/fast/force/ci below) -- re-passed explicitly so a stage the user
    asked to skip stays skipped inside the wrapper too, instead of the inner
    denver re-computing 'stages:' from scratch with no memory of them and
    running it anyway.
    --quiet (repeated ``quiet`` times, so e.g. -qq's level 2 survives, not
    just a single -q)/--fast/--force/--ci are re-passed explicitly: all were
    consumed out of ``forwarded`` by the outer main(), so the inner denver
    wouldn't otherwise know to honour them too -- none of these are read
    back out of a real environment variable, so there's no other way for the
    inner process to inherit them. ``forwarded`` (already stripped of any
    '--' marker by the outer main(), see resolve_command) is re-introduced
    with a fresh '--' here, so the re-invoked denver's own argv splitting
    (main() splits on the first literal '--') separates it from denver's own
    flags again instead of trying to parse it as one of them.
    ``start_time`` (hidden --start-time flag) is the outer denver's own
    ``time.time()`` at the very start of run_stages() -- carried across so
    the "env started in Ns" line the inner denver prints right before
    launching the command reflects the *whole* startup (including the
    outer denver's own wrapper-stage work), not just the inner process's
    own, much shorter, wall-clock.
