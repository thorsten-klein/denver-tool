# Architecture

## Overview

Setting up a dev environment usually means running a handful of tools in
the right order, each building on what the last one set up — get into the
right OS, install native toolchains, create a Python venv, fetch source
repos. denver makes that sequence declarative: maintain your environment in
a `denver.yml`, and `denver` will run it.

This document is the reference for that file and for the machinery behind
it. Terms used here (*environment*, *stage*, *step*, *provider*, *resolved
config*, ...) are defined once in [`glossary.md`](glossary.md); each
provider's own config keys are documented under [`providers/`](providers/).

## Core model

An *environment* is a `denver.yml`; it declares an ordered list of *stages*
under `stages:`; each stage names a `provider:` type (`pip`, `conan`,
`zephyr`, `docker`, `custom`) plus some provider-specific keys in a
top-level section of the stage's own name.

A provider is a generic, reusable engine — all project specifics come from
the `denver.yml` itself, never from the provider's own code. Most
providers build a piece of the environment in place (create a venv,
install tools, update a workspace); one, `docker`, is different: instead
of building anything itself, it relocates the rest of the pipeline into a
container (see "Wrapper / relocation" below).

A stage id is only a label. The section must always declare its
`provider:` explicitly, even when the id happens to match a provider name —
no type is ever guessed from an id. That is what lets one environment run
two `pip` stages (say `pip` and `pip-zephyr`, targeting the same or
different venvs) at different points of the pipeline.

## The `denver.yml` schema

### Top-level keys

Exactly eight keys are recognised at the top level; everything else at that
level must be a stage id declared in `stages:` (anything else is an error —
see "Fail loud" in [`philosophy.md`](philosophy.md)).

- **`version`** — the `denver.yml` schema version this file is written
  against. The only value this denver understands is `"1.0"`; any other
  value is rejected with a clear message rather than silently
  misinterpreted. Optional, but worth setting: it exists so a future,
  incompatible schema change can't quietly do the wrong thing to an old
  file. Compared as a string, so YAML parsing `1.0` as a float doesn't
  matter.
- **`denver-version`** — the minimum denver *tool* version this file needs,
  e.g. `denver-version: ">=1.0.4"`. See "Requiring a denver version" below.
- **`import`** — a list of environments (or YAML files) whose configuration
  is inherited as a base, before this file's own content is applied on top.
  See "Layering" below.
- **`stages`** — the ordered list of stage ids to run. This *is* the
  pipeline; order is significant, and each id must have a matching top-level
  section declaring its `provider:`.
- **`command`** — the default command to run once the environment is built,
  when none is given on the command line. If unset, denver falls back to the
  `docker:` section's `default-cmd:`, then `$SHELL`, then `bash`. A command
  passed on the CLI after `--` always wins over this.
- **`runnable`** — set to `false` to mark this file as a base meant only to
  be imported, never started directly; `denver <that env>` then fails with an
  explanatory message. Deliberately *not* inherited: an env importing a
  `runnable: false` base is itself runnable unless it says otherwise.
- **`env`** — a mapping of environment variables to set for the whole
  environment (values go through `${...}` interpolation). Applied once,
  right after the `env` hook, before any stage runs.
- **`hooks`** — scripts sourced at fixed points in the pipeline. See "Hooks"
  below.

### Requiring a denver version

`version:` pins the *schema*; `denver-version:` pins the *tool*. Those are
two different questions, and only the second one has a good answer for the
common case: a purely additive change — a new provider key, a new flag —
never bumps the schema version, but a `denver.yml` relying on it still needs
a denver new enough to have it. Without `denver-version:`, running such a
file on an older denver fails somewhere deep inside a stage, or quietly does
something subtly different; with it, denver says so up front:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
denver-version: ">=1.0.4"   # directly below version:, always
```

- The value is a version requirement, quoted (an unquoted `>=…` is not
  valid YAML). A bare version means "at least this one", so
  `denver-version: "1.0.4"` and `">=1.0.4"` are the same requirement.
- `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `==` and `!=` are all understood, and several
  comma-separated specifiers are ANDed: `">=1.0.4, <2"`.
- Requirements are checked against the *merged* config, like every other
  top-level key: an env inherits its base's requirement through `import:`.
  Two stacked layers stating a *different* requirement is the usual
  conflicting-strings error — prefix the overriding one with `!` to mean it
  (see "Layering" below).
- The version denver compares against is the one it is really running:
  from the checkout's git tags when denver runs out of a checkout (the
  plain `src/denver.py` script *and* an editable install, whose packaging
  metadata is frozen at install time and would go stale), otherwise from
  the installed distribution's metadata. `denver --version` prints the
  same value. In the rare case where neither can answer (a source copy with
  no git history and no install at all), the requirement is reported as
  unverifiable — a warning, not a failure.
- A commit past a tag counts as newer than that tag (`1.0.3-2-gabc1234`
  satisfies `">=1.0.3"`), and a pre-release counts as older than its
  release (`1.1.0.dev3+g1234567` does not satisfy `">=1.1.0"`).

A denver too old to know the key at all (before it was introduced) rejects
the file with `unknown top-level key(s) denver-version` — different wording,
same conclusion: that denver is too old for this `denver.yml`.

### Generic stage keys

Four keys may appear in *any* stage's section, whatever its provider:

- **`provider`** (**required**) — which provider engine runs this stage:
  `pip`, `conan`, `zephyr`, `docker` or `custom`.
- **`description`** — free text (a list of strings) with whatever notes are
  useful to whoever reads the config: what this stage is for, why it's
  configured this way. denver never reads it; it is only surfaced in
  `--show-config`.
- **`disabled`** — `true` opts this stage out of the normal pipeline, as if
  it had been `--skip`ped, without deleting its configuration. Must be a
  real boolean.
- **`scripts`** — the generic one-shot mechanism: `scripts: <name>: [...]`
  declares scripts run by `denver <env> --run <name>` instead of the normal
  pipeline. See "Hooks and scripts" below.

Every other key in a stage's section must be one the stage's own provider
recognises — see that provider's page under [`providers/`](providers/). An
unrecognised key is an error, not silently ignored.

### Variable interpolation

Any string value in a `denver.yml` may contain `${VAR}` or
`${VAR:-fallback}`, expanded against the environment denver is building
(so a variable exported by an earlier hook or stage is visible to a later
one). An unset variable with no fallback expands to the empty string.

Alongside the real environment, denver seeds a few built-ins of its own,
which always reflect the current run even if a stale variable of the same
name is already exported:

- **`DENVER_SRC_DIR`** — where denver's own code lives.
- **`DENVER_ENV_DIR`** — this environment's directory (the one holding its
  `denver.yml`).
- **`DENVER_ENV_NAME`** — that directory's name.
- **`DENVER_ENV_WORKDIR`** — denver's own working area for this environment
  (`<DENVER_DIR>/.envs/<env>`): venvs, caches, logs, `performance.jsonl`.
- **`SHELL_PROMPT_PREFIX`** — `(<env>) `: the text marking a shell as
  running inside this environment, so a prompt reads
  `(raspberry-pico) dev@host:~/ws$`. fish reads this natively from **fish
  4.8.0** onwards (see below).

These are exported into the environment too, so scripts, compose files and
the final command can read them as ordinary variables. `DENVER_STATE_DIR` —
the one variable denver *reads* rather than sets — is documented in the
top-level [`../README.md`](../README.md).

### The prompt marker

denver marks the shell it starts by writing the prompt variables **the
shells themselves define** — it contributes to them, it does not own them:

| Variable | Shell | denver writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PROMPT_COMMAND` | bash | its snippet, appended after whatever was there |
| `PROMPT` | zsh | `(<env>) %m%#` — short host, then `%` (or `#` for root) |
| `SHELL_PROMPT_PREFIX` | fish ≥ 4.8.0 | `(<env>) ` |

**`PS1` is deliberately not set.** An interactive bash re-reads its rc files
after denver execs it and assigns `PS1` outright, so anything denver put
there would be discarded before the user ever saw it. `PROMPT_COMMAND` is
bash's answer to exactly that — it runs after those rc files, before every
prompt — so that is where the marker goes for bash instead.

The `PROMPT_COMMAND` snippet is idempotent: it re-applies the prefix only if
it isn't already present (bash would otherwise grow `PS1` by one copy per
prompt), and a wrapper provider re-invoking denver inside a container never
appends a second copy.

One ordering subtlety, handled in `Context._prefix_prompt`: in zsh `PROMPT`
and `PS1` are the *same* parameter, so an inherited `PS1` would win over
denver's `PROMPT` if it happened to come later in `environ`. `PROMPT` is
therefore always written last, so zsh keeps the zsh-syntax value.

## Config resolution

Loading a `denver.yml` goes through a fixed sequence, and understanding it
explains a lot of otherwise-surprising behavior:

1. **`import:` chain.** Each `import:` entry points at another env (or
   directly at a YAML file); that file is loaded the same way, recursively,
   then merged in as the base *before* the importing file's own content is
   applied on top. A circular `import:` chain is an error.
2. **Merge rules.** Mappings merge key by key, recursively. A *list* is
   appended to, not replaced — a lower layer's entries plus this layer's
   own, in that order, so a derived env only needs to list what it *adds*.
   Prefix one entry with `!` to drop everything from lower layers, or use a
   bare `<overwrite>` entry to do the same as a pure marker (it's removed from
   the merged list, unlike `!foo` which keeps `foo`). A *string*
   works the same way: two layers disagreeing on the same string key (e.g.
   `pip.python: "3.11"` vs `"3.12"`) is treated as a likely mistake and is a
   hard error, unless the overriding value is explicitly prefixed with `!`
   (e.g. `python: "!3.12"`) to say "yes, replace it on purpose." For both,
   `!` only means anything when there's an actual lower-layer value to
   override — on a brand new key it's an ordinary character.
3. **Section-level `import:`** ("stacking") lets one stage's section pull
   its content from another env's section, instead of (or in addition to)
   inheriting the whole file — see "Layering" below.
4. **Every provider's defaults are filled in centrally**, before any stage
   actually runs — never guessed inside the stage itself at run time. The
   practical effect: `--show-config` always shows *exactly* the config a
   real run would use, values already defaulted and all. If a value looks
   wrong in `--show-config`, it will be exactly as wrong in the real run —
   there's no separate "what setup() actually decides" to go check.
5. **Unknown keys are an error**, not silently ignored — a typo'd key at
   the top level, or a key not recognised by a stage's own provider, dies
   immediately rather than quietly doing nothing.

`--show-config` prints the result of this whole sequence and exits. It is
the single best way to understand what an environment really does, imports
included.

## Layering

`import:` is what lets several environments share configuration without
copy-pasting it:

- **Whole-file `import:`** inherits another env's entire stack as a base,
  e.g. a project-specific env importing a shared base that already
  declares `stages:`, `docker:`, `conan:`, `pip:`. The importing file only
  needs to state what's actually different for it.
- **Section-level `import:`** stacks just one section from another env,
  e.g. a `docker:` section pulling in a shared base's `docker:` config
  without inheriting that base's *entire* stack. An entry can point at a
  specific section by name (`path:section`) instead of always the
  same-named one.

A base env that only exists to be imported should set `runnable: false`, so
starting it directly fails with an explanation instead of half-building
something nobody meant to run.

## Command-line overrides

- **`-c KEY.PATH=VALUE`** overrides one value in the resolved config,
  addressed by a dotted path (e.g. `-c pip.python=3.13`). Any missing
  parent section along the path is created automatically. `KEY.PATH+=VALUE`
  appends to an existing list/string/number instead of replacing it. The
  value is parsed as YAML, so `-c pip.no-index=true` sets a real boolean,
  not the string `"true"`. Repeatable; later `-c`s win over earlier ones
  targeting the same path.
- **`-cf FILE`** overlays a whole YAML file on top of the env's own
  `denver.yml`, using the exact same merge rules as `import:`. Repeatable,
  applied in the order given.
- **Ordering**: every `-cf` file is applied first (in order), then every
  `-c` override, last — so `-c` always has the final word over `import:`
  and `-cf` alike.

Both compose with `--show-config`, so you can check what an override
actually does before running it for real.

## Hooks and scripts

A hook is a script *sourced* (not just executed) at a fixed point, so its
exports become part of the environment everything after it runs in:

- **`env`** — once, before any stage; its exports apply to the whole
  environment.
- **`pre-<stage>` / `post-<stage>`** — around each individual stage.
- **`pre-cmd`** — right before the final command launches.

Each hook name can be declared by any layer in the `import:` chain
(`hooks: <name>:`, a list or a single path); a derived env's own hook never
silently replaces a base env's hook of the same name — both run, base
first.

Separately, `scripts:` is a generic, open-ended mechanism for one-shot
actions that are *not* part of the normal pipeline: any stage's section can
declare `scripts: <name>: [...]`, and `denver <env> --run <name>` runs
every stage's own `<name>` entries, then exits without doing anything else.
Nothing about `<name>` is fixed — `setup` and `login` are just conventions,
not flags of their own. This is where one-time host setup belongs: installing
Docker itself, `udev` rules for flashing a board, a registry login — things
that must not run on every start.

## Fast by default

Every stage that does real work computes a fingerprint (a checksum of its
relevant inputs — requirement files, recipe content, workspace state, ...)
and compares it against the last successful run's. Nothing changed →
nothing expensive re-runs.

- **`--fast`** skips every stage's (re-)build step entirely and only
  activates what a previous full run already built — it never looks at
  fingerprints, it just assumes there's nothing to do. Run once without
  `--fast` first; a stage dies with a clear message if it has nothing to
  activate yet.
- **`--force`** is the opposite extreme: bypass every fingerprint and
  redo the expensive work unconditionally, even if nothing looks changed.
- **`--ci`** swaps in narrower/faster args a stage judges appropriate for a
  CI runner instead of an interactive host (e.g. a shallow clone).

Neither `--force` nor `--ci` is ever read from a real environment variable
— both only ever come from the flag itself, so behavior can't silently
change based on what happens to be exported in the calling shell.

Each provider's page under [`providers/`](providers/) documents exactly what
`--fast` and `--force` mean for that provider.

## Stage filtering

- **`--until <stage>`** truncates the pipeline: every stage up to and
  including `<stage>` runs, everything after is dropped. There's no
  "run only this one stage" flag — a stage practically always needs the
  ones before it.
- **`--skip <stage>`** removes individual stages from whatever `--until`
  left; repeatable.
- **`disabled: true`** in a stage's own section opts it out by default,
  without `--skip` having to name it on every invocation.
- Naming a stage id that isn't in `stages:` is an error. A filtered-out
  stage's own section is left out of `--show-config`'s output too, along
  with its id in `stages:`.

## Wrapper / relocation

A wrapper stage (`docker`, or a `custom` stage with `launcher:`) doesn't
build the environment itself — it relocates the rest of the pipeline into
somewhere else (a container). Running an env that stacks a wrapper
builds/enters that container and re-invokes denver *inside* it with that
wrapper stage skipped, so the remaining stages build the environment there
instead of on the host. `--skip <wrapper stage>` (e.g. `--skip docker`) runs
the exact same stack directly on the host instead, skipping the relocation
entirely.

That symmetry is deliberate: the host and container paths run the same
stages from the same config, so "does it work without Docker?" is one flag
away rather than a separate code path.

## Quiet levels

- **`-q`** silences info lines, echoed commands, and the output of
  internally-run build tools — but each stage's own progress banner and
  "finished in Ns" summary still show, so a long-running invocation stays
  legible.
- **`-qq`** additionally silences the banners and summaries too, so only
  the final launched command's own output reaches the terminal.
- Errors are always reported, at any level.

## Performance tracing

Every stage's runtime is appended to
`<DENVER_ENV_WORKDIR>/performance.jsonl` as JSON Lines of Chrome Trace Event
Format events. Concatenate them into a `{"traceEvents": [...]}` document to
load in `chrome://tracing` or <https://ui.perfetto.dev> and see where a slow
first run actually spent its time.
