# Examples

Eight real, working environments live under
[`examples/`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/)
in the repository, ordered smallest to largest. Each has its own README
explaining what it does, why it exists and what it is meant to teach. They
are not illustrative snippets — every `examples/*/denver.yml` has its
`--show-config` output pinned as a golden-file fixture under `tests/golden/`,
so an example that drifted out of sync with the code fails the build.

## Overview

| Example | Stages | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| [`simple-env`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/simple-env) | 3 × `custom` | The whole model at minimum size. Also the `cmd:` vs `source:` demo |
| [`zephyr-uv`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-uv) | `uv` | A virtualenv and nothing else — proof that no container or toolchain is required |
| [`raspberry-pico`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/raspberry-pico) | `uv` → `conan` | A cross-compilation toolchain **without Docker**. Why stage order matters |
| [`zephyr-docker`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-docker) | `docker` | The container layer on its own — a wrapper stage, and `env-scripts:` |
| [`howto-env`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/howto-env) | `docker` → `uv` → `custom` → `conan` → `custom` | Four providers in one small env — run end to end in [Denver in 5 minutes](five-minutes.md) and built from scratch in [Creating environments](creating-environments.md). Also: a prebuilt binary installed by hand, right next to the same job done by conan |
| [`zephyr-devshell`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-devshell) | *(base — not runnable)* | The shared base: `import:`, layering, `runnable: false` |
| [`zephyr-devshell-4.3.1`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-devshell-4.3.1) | `docker` → `uv` → `conan` → `zephyr` → `custom` | A full Zephyr RTOS setup — the extreme case, and what `import:` layering looks like at full size |
| [`doc-env`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/doc-env) | `uv` → `custom` | Builds *this documentation* with Sphinx — denver used on itself |

## Running the bundled examples

```bash
./src/denver.py examples/simple-env                 # start it (opens a shell)
./src/denver.py examples/simple-env -- echo hi      # run one command in it instead
./src/denver.py examples/simple-env --show-config   # print the merged config and exit
```

`--show-config` is the fastest way to understand an example env you didn't write: it
resolves the whole `import:` chain and prints what denver actually ended up
with. It needs no toolchain, no network and no Docker, so it works for every
env here — including `zephyr-devshell`, which cannot be started.

**Next:** the reference half of this documentation — the
[`denver` command](../cli/arguments.md) for every flag, the full
[`denver.yml` schema](../configuration/denver-yml.md) for every key, and one
page [per provider](../providers/uv.md) for the keys a given stage type
accepts.
```
