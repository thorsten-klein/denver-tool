# docker provider

A `docker` stage is a *wrapper*, not a builder — see "Wrapper / relocation"
in [Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md). Instead of building anything itself, it relocates the
rest of the pipeline into a docker compose service.

```toml
[my-docker-stage]
provider = "docker"

[my-docker-stage.compose]
file = "docker-compose.yml"
```

(`provider:`/`description:`/`disabled:`/`depends-on:`/`skip-on-success:`/`skip-on-failure:`/`scripts:`/
`env:`/`env-prepend:`/`env-append:` are generic keys every stage has —
see "Generic stage keys" in [Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md). Everything below is specific to `docker`.)

## Requires

**`docker` with the Compose plugin must be available** on the machine this
stage runs on — denver never installs it, and every command it issues is a
`docker compose ...` one (v2, the plugin — not the standalone
`docker-compose` script). The stage checks both upfront (`docker` on `PATH`,
then `docker compose version`) and dies naming whichever is missing, rather
than failing deep inside the first `compose build`/`compose run`. Skipped
under `--dry-run`, so an env can still be previewed on a machine without
docker. The daemon has to be reachable for the invoking user, too. Point
`exe:` at a specific docker binary if `docker` isn't the right exe.

## Setting up Docker

Three things have to be true before a `docker` stage can run, none of which
denver does for you:

1. **Docker itself is installed**, with the Compose plugin (`docker compose
   ...`, not the old standalone `docker-compose`). On Linux, follow
   [Docker's own install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   for your distribution — the Compose plugin is included by default on a
   current install. On macOS or Windows, [Docker
   Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) bundles both.
2. **The daemon is running**, and **your user can reach it** without
   `sudo`. On Linux that usually means being in the `docker` group
   (`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`, then log out and back in) — running
   every `docker` command as root instead works too, but nothing in denver
   assumes it. Docker Desktop handles this for you.
3. **Check it actually works**, the same way this stage checks it:

   ```bash
   docker compose version
   ```

   If that prints a version instead of an error, this stage is ready to run.

Anything beyond that — a private registry login, an `udev` rule for a USB
device the container needs — is project-specific, not part of getting
Docker itself working. That kind of one-time setup usually belongs in an
env's own `scripts: setup:` (see
[`scripts:`](../configuration/denver-toml.md#hooks-and-scripts) in
Configuration) rather than something a reader has to remember to do by hand
before their first run.

## Key reference

- **`exe`** (default: `docker` on `PATH`) — the docker executable.
- **`registries`** (default `[]`) — ordered list of `{url, username,
  password}` entries to check, each as `<url>/<image>`, once `compose.image:` has
  missed locally (or `--force` is set — see below), before ever
  considering a build: each entry in turn, via `docker manifest inspect`
  — **never** a real `docker pull` — first hit wins and no further entry
  is tried. On a hit, `$DENVER_DOCKER_IMAGE` is repointed from the bare
  `compose.image:` tag to that entry's full `<url>/<image>` ref, so the actual
  pull happens lazily, later, whenever `docker compose run` itself needs
  the image. Empty (the default) disables this entirely. If nothing is
  found anywhere and `compose.build: false`, denver dies with a clear
  error instead of silently doing nothing. `url:` is required per entry;
  `username:`/`password:` are optional but, if either is set, both must
  be — when present, `docker login <url>` runs automatically, credentials
  piped via stdin (never argv, never logged), right before the manifest
  check against that entry; an entry with neither is assumed
  already-authenticated or public. Both fields go through denver's normal
  `${VAR}` interpolation, so a literal (`myusername`) and an
  env-var-sourced secret (`${DOCKER_PASSWORD_DOCKERHUB}`) are written the same
  way.
- **`compose.file`** (**required**) — a single path or a list for multiple
  `-f` overlays — never guessed, see "Explicit over implicit" in
  [`../concepts/philosophy.md`](../concepts/philosophy.md).
- **`compose.service`** (default `"dev"`) — the compose service `run`/`build`
  target.
- **`compose.build`** (default `true`) — whether a build is ever attempted
  (see below).
- **`compose.default-cmd`** — the fallback interactive command once relocated into
  the container, read by denver's own command resolution (`command:` at
  the top level still wins over this if set) — not read by this provider
  itself, but still a real `docker.compose:` key, shown in `--show-config-full`
  even when unset. When
  it (or the top-level `command:`, or the plain `$SHELL`/`bash` fallback)
  names a bare `bash`/`zsh`/`fish`, denver wires up `denver complete` for
  it automatically before landing there — the container's own image,
  unlike the host, is never something a user already has completion set
  up in themselves. Anything else (extra args aside, which are preserved)
  is left untouched. See [Shell completion](../cli/completion.md) for the
  full mechanism.
- **`compose.image`** — the canonical local tag denver checks for before falling
  back to a build — checked whenever `compose.image:` is set, whether or not
  `registries:` is also configured; a hit skips the build entirely
  (`--force` overrides this, see below). Exported as `$DENVER_DOCKER_IMAGE`
  before build/run, so the compose file can say `image:
  "${DENVER_DOCKER_IMAGE}"` instead of hard-coding the same tag a second
  time — denver doesn't cross-check the two, this is just how they stay in
  sync. If unset, `$DENVER_DOCKER_IMAGE` is an empty string, the local
  check never runs, and `registries:` is silently ignored (nothing to
  search a registry *for* without a tag) rather than an error.
- **`compose.run-args`** (default `["--rm"]`) — extra `docker compose run` args.

Need something computed at runtime before build/run — a compose `.env` file,
a login, anything a static compose file can't express? Use a `hooks:
pre-<stage>:` script (see "Hooks and scripts" in
[Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md)) rather than a `docker:`-specific key — it runs on the
host right before this stage's `setup()`, same timing, without denver
needing a per-provider mechanism for it.

## Design notes

- **`compose.build: true` (the default) does nothing without `compose.image:`.**
  denver never calls `docker compose build` unless `compose.image:` is set — with
  no tag to check next time, it would just rebuild on every single run,
  defeating the point. Set `compose.image:` to get denver's own build-once
  behavior: it builds the first time, then a local (or `registries:`) hit
  skips the build on every run after that. Without `compose.image:`, `compose
  build`/`compose run` are left to the compose file's own `build:` section
  to sort out, exactly as if denver's docker provider weren't managing
  images at all. Set `compose.build: false` for the opposite of the
  `compose.image:`-managed case: nothing gets built, ever, denver just relocates
  into whatever image is already there — e.g. one pulled as part of a
  `hooks: pre-<stage>:` script or a CI step outside denver entirely.
- **Host vs. container.** `setup()` (build the image)
  always runs on the host — that's the only place the `docker` CLI
  operates. `wrap()` (turn the resolved command into `docker compose run
  ...`) is what actually relocates execution. Each prints its own progress
  banner (`--verbose` only, see [CLI Arguments](../cli/arguments.md)) —
  `setup()`'s `prepare` and then whichever of "build"/"found
  locally"/"found on a registry"/skipped applies, `wrap()`'s `run` last —
  so the relocation itself is visible under `-v`, not silent between the
  last `setup()` line and the container's own output.
- **`--fast` has no effect here.** Unlike uv/conan/zephyr, this provider
  doesn't thread `--fast` through `setup()` at all — `compose.build:` is
  read exactly as configured, so a real `docker compose build` still runs
  under `--fast` if the image wasn't found locally or on a registry. The
  local/`registries:` lookup itself is cheap and read-only, so it always
  runs regardless.
- **`--force`** is the escape hatch back to "always rebuild": it ignores a
  locally-cached `image:` hit, though a `registries:` entry that already
  has it still wins over a forced local rebuild — a rebuild only actually
  happens if none of the configured registries have it either.
- **`--dry-run`** prints the `docker compose build` and
  `docker compose run` commands instead of running them; no container is
  ever started. The local/`registries:` existence checks still run (they're
  the read-only queries deciding whether a build would be shown at all),
  but the `docker login` that would precede a private-registry check does
  not — so a private entry may report a miss it wouldn't report for real.
  The bigger limit is structural: since the container is never entered,
  the setup stages that run *inside* it can't be previewed. denver prints
  a note saying so; use `--skip <docker stage>` to preview that same stack
  on the host instead.
- **Multi-registry check, local-first, never pulling in `setup()`.** When
  several places might already have the image — a shared registry, a
  personal mirror, whatever a CI run pushed to — `registries:` lets denver
  search them in a fixed order instead of only knowing about one, using
  `docker manifest inspect` to check existence without downloading
  anything. It's still fully explicit: nothing is scanned or guessed, only
  the entries named in the list are ever tried, in the order given. The
  actual image transfer is left entirely to `docker compose run` itself,
  once denver has pointed `$DENVER_DOCKER_IMAGE` at whichever ref (local
  tag or a specific registry's) should be used.
- **Automated per-registry login, inline.** Each `registries:` entry can
  carry its own `username:`/`password:` right alongside its `url:`, so a
  private registry in the search list doesn't need a separate manual
  login step (e.g. a `scripts: login:` entry run via `denver run <env>
  --scripts login`, [Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md)'s generic one-shot mechanism) — denver logs in
  for you, right before it's actually needed, only for entries that carry
  credentials.
