# Examples

You can find some working denver environments under
[`examples/`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/)
in the repository. Each has its own README
explaining what it does, why it exists and what it is meant to teach. They
are not illustrative snippets — every `examples/*/denver.toml` has its
`--show-config-full` output pinned as a golden-file fixture under `tests/golden/`,
so an example that drifted out of sync with the code fails the build.

## Overview

| Example | Stages | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| [`simple-env`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/simple-env) | 3 × `custom` | The whole model at minimum size. Also the `cmd:` vs `source:` demo |
| [`zephyr-uv`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-uv) | `uv` | A virtualenv and nothing else — proof that no container or toolchain is required |
| [`raspberry-pico`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/raspberry-pico) | `custom` → `download` → `git` → `download` | A cross-compilation toolchain **without Docker, and without Conan**. `git`/`download` instead of hand-vendored archives; `unpack-cmd:` that builds, not just unpacks |
| [`zephyr-docker`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-docker) | `docker` | The container layer on its own — a wrapper stage, and a `hooks: pre-docker:` script |
| [`firmware-env`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/firmware-env) | `docker` → `uv` → `custom` → `download` → `conan` → `custom` | Five providers in one small env — run end to end and built from scratch in [denver in 30 minutes](30-minutes.md). Also: the same job (a pinned prebuilt binary on `PATH`) done three ways — by hand, by `download`, by conan |
| [`zephyr-devshell`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-devshell) | *(base — not runnable)* | The shared base: `import:`, layering, `runnable: false` |
| [`zephyr-devshell-4.3.1`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/zephyr-devshell-4.3.1) | `docker` → `uv` → `conan` → `zephyr` → `custom` | A full Zephyr RTOS setup — the extreme case, and what `import:` layering looks like at full size |
| [`doc-env`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/examples/doc-env) | `uv` → `custom` | Builds *this documentation* with Sphinx — denver used on itself |

## Running the bundled examples

```bash
./src/denver.py examples/simple-env                 # start it (opens a shell)
./src/denver.py examples/simple-env -- echo hi      # run one command in it instead
./src/denver.py examples/simple-env --show-config   # print the resulting config
```

`--show-config` is the fastest way to understand an example env you didn't write: it
resolves the whole `import:` chain and prints what denver actually ended up
with. It needs no toolchain, no network and no Docker, so it works for every
env.
