# Glossary

Every term denver uses, defined once. The rest of the documentation assumes
these definitions.

## The core model

**Environment** — a directory containing a `denver.toml`, and the unit denver
launches: `denver run <env>`. An environment is fully described by its
`denver.toml` (plus whatever that file explicitly points at); reading the file
tells you everything the environment does. `<env>` may also be a path
directly to a TOML file, so one directory can hold several variants side by
side (`denver.debug.toml`, `denver.release.toml`).

**`denver.toml`** — the config file describing one environment: which stages
run, in what order, and how each is configured. Its schema is documented in
[Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md).

**Stage** — one entry in `stages:`: a provider type plus its own config
section, run in order. The entry is the *stage id*, and the top-level section
of the same name is that stage's config. A stage id is just a label — the
section must always declare `provider: <name>` explicitly — which is what
lets one environment run two `uv` stages (e.g. `uv` and `uv-zephyr`)
targeting different venvs.

**Provider** — the generic engine behind a stage type. denver ships five:
`uv`, `conan`, `zephyr`, `docker` and `custom`. A provider holds no
project-specific knowledge; everything specific comes from the `denver.toml`
section it is given. See [`providers/`](https://github.com/thorsten-klein/denver/tree/develop/doc/providers).

**Extension provider** — a project's own `Provider` subclass, registered via
`extensions: providers: dirs:` instead of being built into denver. Behaves
exactly like a built-in provider everywhere else once registered — see
"Extension providers" in [Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md).

**Step** — a stage's own internal sub-phase, e.g. conan's
prepare/export/install or uv's ensure-python/ensure-venv/install/activate.
Each step prints its own banner line (`--verbose` only — see **Verbose**), in
whatever order the provider actually does the work; there is deliberately no
"step 3 of 7" numbering to keep in sync with the code.

Every stage is announced by a single `-- [i/n] stage '<id>' (<provider>)`
line before its first step — shown at the default verbosity, unlike the
finer step banners below it — emitted by denver itself rather than by the
provider — so a stage that fails before doing anything (a missing tool, a
bad path) has still said which stage it is, and `<id>` is exactly what
`--skip` takes. Stages report in `stages:` order whether they run or are
skipped, so the trail reads as the pipeline it describes.

**Setup provider** (`kind: setup`) — a provider that builds part of the
environment in place: creates a venv, installs tools, updates a workspace.
`uv`, `conan` and `zephyr` are setup providers; `custom` is one unless it
declares `launcher:`.

**Wrapper provider** (`kind: wrapper`) — a provider that builds nothing
itself and instead relocates the final command somewhere else, e.g. into a
container. `docker` is denver's wrapper provider; a `custom` stage with
`launcher:` acts as one too.

**Wrapper relocation** — what running an environment that stacks a wrapper
actually does: denver builds/enters the container and re-invokes *itself*
inside it with `--skip <that stage>`, so the remaining setup stages build the
environment in there rather than on the host. Skipping the wrapper yourself
(`denver run <env> --skip docker`) runs the exact same stack directly on the
host.

## Configuration

**Resolved config** — a stage's config section after every default has been
filled in centrally, before any stage runs. This is exactly what
`--show-config` prints, and exactly what a real run uses — the two can never
disagree, because a provider's `setup()` never computes a default of its own.

**Whole-file `import:`** — one `denver.toml` inheriting another environment's
entire stack as a base, then adding or overriding only what differs. This is
how a version-specific environment reuses a shared base without copy-pasting
its `stages:`/`docker:`/`conan:`/`uv:` config.

**Section-level `import:`** (also called *stacking*) — one stage section
pulling its content from another environment's section, without inheriting
that environment's entire stack. An entry may name a specific section
(`path:section`) instead of the same-named one.

**Merge rules** — how two layers combine: mappings merge key by key
recursively; lists append (lower layer's entries first); two layers setting
the same string key to different values is a hard error unless the override
is prefixed with `!`. See [Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md) for the
details, including the `<overwrite>` marker.

**Interpolation** — `${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}` expansion inside `denver.toml`
values, resolved against the environment denver is building (including its
own built-ins such as `DENVER_ENV_DIR`).

**Hook** — a script *sourced* (not merely executed) at a fixed point, so its
exports become part of the environment everything after it runs in. The hook
points are `env` (once, before any stage), `pre-<stage>` / `post-<stage>`
(around each stage), and `pre-cmd` (right before the final command).

**`scripts:` / `--scripts <name>`** — the generic, open-ended one-shot
mechanism, distinct from hooks: any stage section may declare `scripts:
<name>: [...]`, and `denver run <env> --scripts <name>` runs every stage's
`<name>` entries and then exits without running the pipeline. `<name>` is
arbitrary — `setup` and `login` are conventions, not built-in flags.

## Execution

**Fingerprint** (or *checksum*) — the mechanism a stage uses to detect that
nothing relevant changed since its last successful run (requirement file
contents, recipe content, workspace state, ...) and skip its own expensive
step. This is what makes a repeat run take seconds instead of minutes.
`--force` bypasses it; `--fast` skips the build step without even checking.

**Dry run** — `--dry-run` walks the pipeline for its description instead of
its effect: each stage's commands and file writes are printed (tagged
`[dry-run <marker>]`, each marker its own color — see
[CLI Arguments](../cli/arguments.md)) rather than performed, and the final
command is printed rather than launched. Read-only queries (`?`) and sourced
scripts (`.`) still run —
they are what the printed commands are derived from. A wrapper stage can't
be previewed past its own boundary; see
[Configuration](../configuration/denver-toml.md#previewing-a-run---dry-run).

**Stage filtering** — restricting which stages run: `--until <stage>`
truncates the pipeline after the named stage, `--skip <stage>` removes
individual stages, and a stage's own `disabled: true` opts it out by default.

**Quiet level** — `-q` silences denver's own output (progress trail, info
lines, everything `-v`/`--verbose` would add) while keeping each stage's own
build-tool output; `-qq` silences that too, leaving only the launched
command's own output. Errors always print. See also **Verbose**.

**Verbose** — `-v`/`--verbose` turns on denver's own diagnostic detail,
hidden by default: each stage's finer sub-step banners, the per-stage/env
performance timings (in blue), and the `+ cmd` echo ahead of every command
denver runs. `-q`/`-qq` always win over it.

**State directory** — where denver keeps everything it builds for one
environment (venv, install trees, fingerprints, logs, `performance.jsonl`):
`<env dir>/.denver/<denver.toml stem>/`, inside the environment's own
directory and ignoring itself via a `.gitignore` denver writes there. Keyed on
the config file, so two variants in one folder — and two checkouts of one
project — never share it.

**`DENVER_STATE_DIR` / `DENVER_CACHE_DIR`** — the two environment variables
denver itself *reads*: an explicit root for the state directory above, and
the shared cache root denver exports for an env to point a tool's own
download cache at. Full explanation in
[Environment variables](../cli/environment-variables.md).
