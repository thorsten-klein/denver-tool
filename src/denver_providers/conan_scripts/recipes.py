"""Catalog tool: prepares conan remotes, then exports/creates/uploads recipes from a recipe catalog.

Invoked by providers.conan.ConanProvider as a subprocess -- see
ConanProvider's module docstring for the denver.yml keys that route to
--prepare/--export/--create/--upload/--ci here. Also runnable standalone for
maintaining a recipe catalog outside of a denver run (--recipes/--remote).

One invocation handles one denver ``conanfiles:`` unit: every
``--recipes-dir`` given (repeatable) is resolved into a *single* catalog, so
recipes in one dir may require recipes in another.

The catalog is built in memory (build_catalog.build()) and consumed straight
from there; it is only written to disk when ``--export-catalog PATH`` says
where (the unit's ``catalog:`` in denver.yml). ``--no-generate`` is the
mirror image: skip the build and read an existing catalog.yml given with
``--catalog-yml``.
